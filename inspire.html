	<br>
<p>My mom has always been threre for me, supported my career goals, and helped me through any of my failings. She is super loving, fun, and I can honestly say I got incredibly lucky to cal her my mom. 
	<br>
	I know other families can't say they are as lucky as that. I'm very grateful for her.
	<br>
My mom is hardworking, dedicated to everything she does and is a great role model to look up to.  She treats everyone around her with kindness and I'm always so suprised how many people she knows. 
		<br>
	She remembers the name of her doctor, dentist, nail artists, anyone and everyone who some people would see as insignificant, but she sees as another person to embrace in her life. She is incredibly 
		<br>
	intelligent and I would love to follow in her footsteps of knowledge and learning. Overall the person who inspires me to be the best version of myself is my mom. </p>
