		<p>I’m not going to lie: I think I have a pretty good travel blog. (You probably do too if you’re here.) 
			I work hard to provide excellent practical travel advice to help you travel better, but I’m not the only great travel blogger out there. 
			In fact — and I know this might be shocking — there’s a lot about travel that I’m not an expert on. Family travel? No idea. Travel as a woman? 
			Clueless. Information on hotels? Only a little. Photography? I can manage to turn my camera on if that counts. Food expert? Only at eating it.</p>
